# Gmail Beta mockups

Static mockups of the old 2004 look of Gmail, for fun.

Currently, only inbox view.

# Running it

Install Flask (pip flask) to run it locally.

The email data comes from generated JSON files under /data. The JSON was generated from the very useful <a href="http://www.json-generator.com/">JSON Generator</a> using the template in /data/emailtemplate.json.
